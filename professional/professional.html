        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am 18 years old.  I live in Ilinnois, USA.
          I am currently enrolled at a community college,
          working towards an IAI associates in science,
          with plans to transfer into a four year university
          to achieve a BS in computer science and cybersecurity.

        <h2>Programming Projects</h2>
        <p>
          I like to start fun projects in programming.
          Oftentimes, when I wonder how something works,
          or wish for a feature or functionality, I'll
          open a new project for fun, to see if I can
          recreate it.  Click here to see some of my ongoing
          projects...

        <h2>Game Development</h2>
        <p>
          Game dev is my passion. I regularly come up with
          ideas for new games, so much so, that I struggle
          to finish any of them before I get a new exciting
          idea.  Click here to see some of my ongoing

        <h2>Novel Writing</h2>
        <p>
          Writing isn't my cup of tea, but I love to read.  I
          had an idea for a novel I would have loved to read,
          and so decided to heed a quote posted in my school:
          "If there is something you want to read, but it doesn't
          exist yet, you must write it."  Click here to see
          my progress so far...

        <h2>Youtube</h2>
        <p>
          Youtube is a place for me to put my thoughts, ideas,
          and progress out into the world.  I like to post
          appetizers into interesting ideas, titled "rants,"
          and I publish devlogs occasionally as well.  Click
          here to see some of my latest and most popular
