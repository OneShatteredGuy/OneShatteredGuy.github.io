          <p>
            I am 18 years old.  I live in Ilinnois, USA.
            I am currently enrolled at a community college,
            working towards an IAI associates in science,
            with plans to transfer into a four year university
            to achieve a BS in computer science and cybersecurity.

          <h2>Programming</h2>
          <p>
            I like to start fun projects in programming.
            Oftentimes, when I wonder how something works,
            or wish for a feature or functionality, I'll
            open a new project for fun, to see if I can
            recreate it.  Click here to see some of my ongoing
            projects...

          <h2>Gamedev</h2>
          <p>
            Gamedev is my passion. I regularly come up with
            ideas for new games, so much so, that I struggle
            to finish any of them before I get a new exciting
            idea.  Click here to see some of my ongoing

          <h2>Writing</h2>
          <p>
            Writing isn't my cup of tea, but I love to read.  I
            had an idea for a novel I would have loved to read,
            and so decided to heed a quote posted in my school:
            "If there is something you want to read, but it doesn't
            exist yet, you must write it."  Click here to see
            my progress so far...
